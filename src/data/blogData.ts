- Algorithms: K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), DBSCAN

 Reinforcement Learning
- Definition: Learning through interaction with an environment
- Examples: Game playing, robotics, autonomous driving
- Algorithms: Q-Learning, Policy Gradient Methods, Actor-Critic

## Popular Machine Learning Algorithms

# Deploy MERN Stack Websites on Vercel: Complete Guide

Deploying MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack applications can be challenging, but Vercel makes it streamlined and efficient. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the entire process.

## Understanding the MERN Stack

The MERN stack combines four powerful technologies:
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing application data
- Express.js: Backend web framework for Node.js
- React: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development

## Why Choose Vercel for MERN Deployment?

Vercel offers several advantages for MERN stack deployment:
- Serverless Functions: Perfect for Express.js APIs
- Automatic Scaling: Handles traffic spikes seamlessly
- Global CDN: Fast content delivery worldwide
- Zero Configuration: Deploy from Git repositories easily
- Environment Variables: Secure configuration management
- Custom Domains: Professional domain setup

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
- A MERN stack application ready for deployment
- GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository
- MongoDB Atlas account for cloud database
- Vercel account (free tier available)
- Node.js and npm installed locally

## Step 1: Prepare Your Backend

Convert your Express.js server to work with Vercel's serverless architecture. Create an api/index.js file that exports your Express app with all routes and database connections.

## Step 2: Configure Vercel Settings

Create a vercel.json file in your project root to configure how Vercel builds and routes your application. This tells Vercel to build your Node.js API and React client separately.

## Step 3: Set Up MongoDB Atlas

Create a MongoDB Atlas cluster and configure it for Vercel deployment:
1. Sign up for MongoDB Atlas (free tier available)
2. Create a new cluster
3. Set up database user credentials
4. Configure network access to allow all IPs for Vercel
5. Get your connection string

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

In your Vercel dashboard, add these environment variables:
- MONGODB_URI: Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
- JWT_SECRET: Secret key for JWT tokens
- NODE_ENV: Set to production

## Step 5: Prepare React Frontend

Update your React app to work with Vercel's routing system. Create a config file for API endpoints that switches between development and production URLs.

## Step 6: Deploy to Vercel

You can deploy using either:
1. Vercel CLI: Install the CLI, login, and deploy from your project root
2. Git Integration: Connect your repository to Vercel for automatic deployments

## Step 7: Configure Custom Domain

Optionally, add a custom domain through the Vercel dashboard. SSL certificates are automatically generated for security.

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
- Use React lazy loading for code splitting
- Implement proper caching headers
- Optimize images using Vercel's Image component
- Analyze bundle size regularly

### Database Optimization
- Implement connection pooling
- Create proper database indexes
- Use efficient MongoDB queries
- Add schema validation

### Security
- Never expose secrets in code
- Configure CORS properly for production
- Implement API rate limiting
- Validate all user inputs

## Monitoring and Debugging

Enable Vercel Analytics to monitor performance, track function execution times, and identify issues. Implement proper logging and error handling throughout your application.

## Common Issues

Watch out for CORS errors, database connection issues, and build failures. Most problems can be solved by checking environment variables, network access settings, and dependency configurations.

## Conclusion

Deploying MERN stack applications on Vercel provides a powerful, scalable solution for modern web applications. With serverless functions and automatic scaling, Vercel simplifies deployment while providing enterprise-grade performance.

Follow these steps to get your MERN application running on Vercel with minimal configuration. Remember to monitor performance and optimize based on real-world usage patterns.
